# Discord-Bot
My discord bot i created using discord.py
for requirments.txt i used pip freeze as pipreqs wasn't working so there will be unnecessary imports.
do pip install -r requirements.txt to install all the imports
i will update this when i update my bot

feel free to pull request to improve the bot if you wish
